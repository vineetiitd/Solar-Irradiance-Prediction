# Solar-Irradiance-Prediction

A machine learning project that leverages data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training to create predictive models. This project utilizes various popular libraries, including Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and TensorFlow, to process data and train classifiers.

## Features

- Data preprocessing with `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler`
- Feature selection using `SelectKBest` and `ExtraTreesClassifier`
- Model training with Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and TensorFlow
- Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

The script will perform the following steps:

Load and preprocess data (including scaling and feature engineering).
Perform feature selection to improve model efficiency and interpretability.
Train machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

Visualization
The script includes several visualization steps, such as:

Feature Importance: Displays key features selected for the model.
Distribution Plots: Shows data distributions to help understand data skewness and scaling needs.
Model Performance: Generates performance metrics and, where applicable, plots confusion matrices or ROC curves.
